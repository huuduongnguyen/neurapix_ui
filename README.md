## About The Project

Provide a more detailed overview of your project here.
* What is the purpose of this application?
* What problems does it solve?
* What are the key functionalities? (e.g., image sharpening, user testimonials, newsletter subscription)

It appears the application includes:
* An image sharpening feature (`sharpen_img.html`).
* A section for user testimonials.
* A user interface with a header, main content area, and footer.
* A user upgrade option and profile display.

## Built With

This project is built with the following major frameworks/libraries:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

The `package.json` also lists these dependencies:
* `@testing-library/jest-dom`
* `@testing-library/react`
* `@testing-library/user-event`
* `web-vitals`

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed on your system.
* **npm**
  sh
  npm install npm@latest -g

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone [https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your_username/neurapix.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your_username/neurapix.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory
    ```sh
    cd neurapix
    ```
3.  Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed\!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back\!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features

  * **Image Sharpening:** Allows users to upload and sharpen images.
  * **User Testimonials:** Displays feedback from users.
  * **Interactive UI:** Modern user interface with header, footer, and dynamic content sections.
  * *(Add any other features your project has)*

## Folder Structure (Inferred)

While not explicitly shown, a typical Create React App structure is expected, with components likely organized within a `src/components` directory for `Header.js`, `Footer.js`, `SharpenSection.js`, and `TestimonialsSection.js`.

  * `public/`: Contains static assets like `sharpen_img.html` (though this seems like a standalone HTML page, it might be for reference or a different part of the project).
  * `src/`:
      * `App.js`: Main application component.
      * `App.css`: Global styles for the App component.
      * `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
      * `index.css`: Global base styles.
      * `components/`: (Assumed directory for UI components)
          * `Header.js`
          * `SharpenSection.js`
          * `TestimonialsSection.js`
          * `Footer.js`
      * `assets/`: (Assumed, for images or other static files used within React components)
  * `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.

The file `signup_style.css` seems to contain styles that are very similar or identical to `sharpen_img.html`. It might be intended for a sign-up page or is a duplicate.
